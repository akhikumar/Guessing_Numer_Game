# Guessing_Numer_Game
guessing number game in all three language C ,  C++ , and Python

For C and C++ language we have to use srand(time(NULL) and include<time.h> because if we don't use this then programm generate same random number for each run 
so we have to use above function so that it's makes use of the computer's internal clock to control the choice of the seed;


But In Python we have a Random Library so we can easily import them to generate number;
